#Command has to be for me/photos/ look up facebook api, also check in place. 

#Make a photos posted table for all :
	Zone, Userid(of some kind), photo link, fb photo link, timestamp,


#Make a tagged photos table
	userid, photo link, keep, hero

# Batcam user photo count table
	userid, tagged count, posted count, keep count, hero count

Make poster interface
	find user with posted count = 0, but tagged count > 0
	open up all his pictures. With checkboxes.


(v2?)
# users vs photos page on batcam pictures
# Open a page to show user photo count for every user

(v3)
Image manipulation:
	Automatic overlaying of template with unique id printed somewhere
	automatic collaging (needs to read photo orientation? But will photos ever be oriented vertically?)
